Tasks
LACP on all servers - start with dev
	- new nms6 sync/copy from old nms6
	- rename new nms1/6 
	- rename old nms1/6 to nms8/9
	- changeover nms1/6 ethernet to new boxes
	- request server moves for nms8/9 (poly and ?)

Dev,Deskside, and more software automation
	- add server manifest
		- keep software up-to-date on which servers?
	- munkireport and FV2?
		- OR something like https://github.com/grahamgilbert/Crypt
		- OR https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2013/04/29/filevault-setup-app-local-filevault-2-encryption-setup-and-enforcement/
		- test key escrow
			=> doesn't auto-upload key info to munkireport, just on/off
			- make/implement key escrow?

	- general-setupMunki.sh, commonImageConfigure.sh, commonImageConfigure-copyMunki.sh can go into production
		=> general-setupMunki.sh can be included in Common workflows
		=> don't push desksideImageConfigure.sh or desksideImageConfigure-copyMunki.sh
			- there's not a good check against use outside of dev
			- for that reason DON'T make deskside workflows call munki scripts outside of Weasel Test workflow(s)

Add suspicious package and/or other dev tools to AutoPkg
	- create recipes for SP (.download and .munki)

Check general-deleteFilevault.sh script to see if any workflows are calling
	- if not, then delete script

What to do with Xserves?
	- server setup automation
		- what to use?
			- script, Chef, Puppet, etc.?
			- how about Munki? run-once?
	- macnms 8/9
	- tech studio?
	- 2nd server for Poly?
		- mod to Netboot Helper
			- Poly 1, Poly 2
			- Tempe 1, Tempe 2
			- $campus 2, other than COMMON selection go to $campus Deskside server
		- can two multicasts sessions coexist on Poly's flat network?
		- (2) more OS X Server licenses?
		- replace boot drives with SSDs
		- add 3rd drive (1TB spinning platter, full backup of data drive + boot drive backup)
		- stagger DS syncing times

tech studio DS setup?
	- what hardware?
	- how to isolate network interfaces
	- needs
	- separate tech studio DS group
	- separate tech studio workflow(s)
	
Logical volume check for DS workflows
	- what workflow(s)?
		- all Deskside?
		- all Common?
	
Network configure script errors
	* add configuration profile for wireless rooms+macbook airs in one place during netboot session, and in the following scripts:
			commonImageConfigure-networkConfigure.sh  (in Scripts)
			commonImage-DSpostActions-networkConfigure.sh  (in leftovers)
			=> files are in Hardware-Software-Addons/Wireless
		* file is WiFi.autojoin.ssm.asu.edu.mobileconfig (on macdev)
			* place in /var/db/ConfigurationProfiles/Setup
		* additional pref file is com.apple.airport.preferences.plist
			* place in /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration
		- ready for case testing:
			- iMac => 2007, 2012, 2013;
			- mini
			* macbookair 
			- macbookpro
				=> models 9,x and under have an ethernet jack; add in logic for this:
				sysctl hw.model | grep MacBookPro | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d [a-z][A-Z],
				=> the above gives output like 112, so compare against a baseline (100)
			- macpro
				=> works, but no need to create Eth1/2 since auto-populate does this for us

check /var/folders cleanout at shutdown script!
	* definitely running on nightly shutdown
	- may need to modify partition size upper limit in order for better functionality

SILC app Antidote
	- test in production

DS reporting using our log files app

Bootpicker and Yosemite
	- alternatives?
		- BootRunner?
		- reFind?

Yosemite COMMON image
	- things that don't work...
		- setup assistant (/var/db/.AppleSetupDone) is still not being written/kept
		- Yahoo Messenger
		- bootpicker
		- CheatSheet needs to be enabled in System Preferences > Accessibility
		- Chess asks about 1.2GB download for speech
		- update to Lockdown Browser
		- Maps barks about privacy setting using your location
		- Sketchup license (and stuff from jan15 fixme)
		- skip the icloud setup 
		- com.apple.notificationcenterui.agent is loaded in launchctl

Make new Yosemite vanilla image
	- push into production?

ELK stack on OSX
	* download ELK
	* figure out installation
	- feed DS logs
