0_new minis for conf room
	- check video sleep problem
		-> appears on HDMI when "Auto Select" is set on the monitor
		-> works as normal when a specific input is selected
	- determine which applications to delete
		- probably can get rid of Adobe, would run prior to post-actions, so good
	- write location-specific deletion

1_new printing setup...
	- lpadmin notes:
		>Cups printing to Windows/Samba queues retains the credentials of the first logged in user 
		>if you don't use any "-o auth-info-required" flag in your lpadmin command, until reboot.
		>we solved the problem using "-o auth-info-required=negotiate", but couldn't find another way 
		>of clearing the previously cached credentials.
	- divvy print servers by campus
		=> if $campus == Tempe, then $1, else $2

1.5_user idle logout timer
	* use profile to set /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist	
		=> key:  com.apple.autologout.AutoLogOutDelay
		=> value: time, in seconds (60 min = 3600)
		=> use "Forced" for profile setting
	* test
		- tests good
		- profile located at macdev2/Robert Junk/mcxToProfile/userIdleLogoutSetting.mobileconfig

2_display setting
	* use special hardware/software column in reimagerTable for refresh rate specials
	* what letters are we already using?
		* a, h, n, s, w
		* how about p?

		- iMac14,....
		- iMac13?
		- iMac12?
		- iMac11?
		- iMac8?
		- iMac7?
		- MacProX?
		- check for model OR for SSD?
			- SSD
				=> system_profiler SPSerialATADataType | awk '/Medium/{print $3$4}' 

3_DS1.6.15
	- netboot sets that will have to be rebuilt:

3.5_make 10.10 COMMON nbi
	- Netboot Helper update
	- how does all the hardware handle 10.10 nbi?

5_Dev,Deskside, and more software automation

		- test key escrow
			=> doesn't auto-upload key info to munkireport, just on/off
			* make/implement key escrow? => Casper do this stuff, unless axed

	- general-setupMunki.sh, commonImageConfigure.sh, commonImageConfigure-copyMunki.sh can go into production
		=> general-setupMunki.sh can be included in Common workflows
		=> don't push desksideImageConfigure.sh or desksideImageConfigure-copyMunki.sh
			- there's not a good check against use outside of dev
			- for that reason DON'T make deskside workflows call munki scripts outside of Weasel Test workflow(s)
		=> add exception for imagebuilder under cpcom358 heading

6_What to do with Xserves?
	- server setup automation

8_Yosemite COMMON image
	- check login/logout hooks + our other config junk
	- specific items...
		- setup assistant (/var/db/.AppleSetupDone) is still not being written/kept

		- can we reset cfprefsd at logout? benefit?
			- what about migrating prefs to a) profile b) defaults c) combination?

			 find /var/folders -name "*.iscachebmp" -type f -exec rm -v "{}" \; 
		- new CC2014 build => test
			- uninstallers, deletions
				* Lightroom
				* upgrade Lightroom catalog prompts
				* remove Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 5 from CC package
		- "What's New in OSX Yosemite popup" => implement the notification center thing to turn of stuff?
		- check System Preferences > Extensions
		- wireless setup is working, but Profile is not being installed...? 
			=> .profileSetupDone gets written but profile not installed
		- What preferences can be set via Profiles?
			=> https://github.com/timsutton/mcxToProfile/blob/master/mcxToProfile.py
				http://www.amsys.co.uk/2015/blog/creating-config-profiles-instead-first-boot-script/#.VTbPR2akUkU

9_ELK stack on OSX (macmgmt.inre.asu.edu)
	* feed DS logs
		-https://github.com/driskell/log-courier
		- OR launchdaemon that calls a simple script that does the work?
			- need agent that runs on servers to check for new files;
			- at specified time, upload to macmgmt
				- add maclogs user to macmgmt, access DSLogs folder
				- after logs are duplicated on macmgmt, move to "uploaded" folder on local server
				- how about at 11p every night
	* queries?
		=> what about feeding our custom-made logs (flags) into ELK?
			* initial test feeding logstash this file ( macnms7-aecp-ecanx-111-e01-D25KJ1U4DNMP-1211 ) with logstashTestConfig.conf
			* modify logImaging.sh script to do csv of values
				=> need the date command to do this:  `date -u +"%Y-%m-%d%H:%M:%SZ"
				=> need to strip special characters from workflow names
				* use "," instead of "-"
			- convert old logs to new format
				=> oldLogDataTransform.sh
				* modify logging in logImaging.sh
***				- push new logImaging.sh to production
			* develop filter for syntax (use csv, example at: http://blog.trifork.com/2014/01/28/using-logstash-elasticsearch-and-kibana-to-monitor-your-video-card-a-tutorial/ )
			* ? need agent on macmgmt to import new stuff into ELK, or does ELK auto-update/import => ELK -can- autoimport if running
